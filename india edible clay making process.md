The clay used in this process is obtained from specific regions in India, known for their mineral-rich soil. This clay is then carefully dug out, ensuring that it is free from any impurities or contaminants.

Common additives include roasted cumin powder, rock salt, black salt, and spices like turmeric and ginger. These additives not only add unique flavors but also provide additional health benefits.</p><p>Once the clay powder and additives are mixed thoroughly, it is ready to be consumed or used in culinary preparations. In India, edible clay is typically consumed by mixing it with water or milk to form a smooth paste. This paste is then consumed either as a standalone snack or as an accompaniment to other dishes.</p><p>Additionally, edible clay is also used in various culinary preparations, especially in traditional Indian sweets. It is added to desserts like laddoos, halwas, and barfis, giving them a distinctive earthy flavor. Edible clay is also used in the making of decorative items like edible clay dolls and ornaments, which are often seen during festivals and cultural events.</p><p>Apart from its culinary uses, edible clay is also known for its medicinal properties. It is believed to have several health benefits, including improving digestion, detoxifying the body, and providing essential minerals. In Ayurvedic medicine, edible clay is often prescribed as a dietary supplement to balance the doshas (energies) in the body.</p><p>The process of making edible clay is an ancient art that showcases the ingenuity and creativity of Indian culture.
