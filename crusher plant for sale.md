Because it is primary crusher, Jaw crusher is designed for long life service with minimum maintenance for hard, tough, abrasive material and overload high capacity.</p><p>Crusher plants are designed based on the characteristics of the materials to be processed to ensure the highest possible crushing efficiency, and the presence of uncrushable materials may affect the crusher plant’s performance. The primary operating costs of a crusher plant, such as electricity, fuel, lubrication, maintenance, plant hire, and operator wages, can be divided into two categories: fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs, which include upfront capital expenditure, are usually incurred once at the beginning of the plant’s operational life. Variable costs, such as maintenance and fuel, are incurred continuously throughout the plant’s operational life.</p><p>The availability of crusher plant for sale in various configurations ensures that all desired product specifications can be achieved and customer satisfaction is maximized. This is achieved through features such as higher crushing speed, optimized kinematics, and longer stroke. Available models range from the highly compact, with a capacity of 10 tons per hour, to the large-scale crusher plant with a capacity of 300-500 tons per hour.</p><p>It is important to select a crusher plant that suits your needs and requirements.
