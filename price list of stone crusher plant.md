Size of raw materials: The size of the raw materials determines the size of the crusher required. If the raw materials are large, a larger crusher will be needed, which will increase the overall cost.</p><p>3. Transport distance: The distance between the quarry and the construction site also affects the price. The longer the distance, the higher the transportation cost and subsequently, the higher the price of the stone crusher plant.</p><p>4. Equipment configuration: Different equipment configurations have different prices. The more advanced the equipment, the higher the price. For example, if the plant is equipped with a vibrating feeder, jaw crusher, impact crusher, vibrating screen, belt conveyor, and other auxiliary equipment, the price will be higher.</p><p>In conclusion, the price range of a stone crusher plant varies greatly depending on the specific needs of the customer.
