Sometimes, the roller surface is smooth, sometimes it's toothed.

It's a great choice for industries such as mining, metallurgy, building material, and chemical, among others.</p><p>When considering the price of a double roll crusher, various factors come into play. One of the main aspects to consider is the quality and efficiency of the machine.

Well-established brands often have a higher price due to the trust and reliability associated with their products.
